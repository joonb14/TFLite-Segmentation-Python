# TFLite-Segmentation-Python
This code snipset is heavily based on <b><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/segmentation/overview">TensorFlow Lite Segmentation</a></b>
The segmentation model can be downloaded from above link.
For the mask generation I looked into the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_segmentation/android">Android Segmentation Example</a>
Follow the <a href="https://github.com/joonb14/TFLite-Segmentation-Python/blob/main/DeepLabv3.ipynb">DeepLabv3.ipynb</a> to get information about how to use the TFLite model in your Python environment.
Thank you
